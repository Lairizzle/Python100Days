#Fucntions can be defined and called
#Python has prexisting functions like; len(), print(), int(), str()
#These execute code based on what arguments you pass into them
#Functions are always called by the name of the function followed by ()

print("Hello")
numChar = len("Hello")
print(numChar)

#Creating or defining your own functions
def myFunction():
    print("Hello")
    print("Bye")

#Call the function by using the name and ()
myFunction()
